## 📖 The Problem
In manufacturing, timing is everything. Running out of raw materials halts the entire production line, costing thousands per hour. But overstocking ties up valuable capital and warehouse space. It’s a delicate balancing act that manual spreadsheets just can’t handle.

I built **Fantastic Food** to fix this. It uses **Machine Learning AI** to analyze historical production data and forecast exact material requirements. It’s about ensuring the factory floor never stops and the warehouse is never overflowing.

## ✨ The Solution
* **AI-Driven Forecasting:** Predicts raw material demand weeks in advance based on production trends.
* **Just-In-Time (JIT) Support:** Helps manufacturers order stock exactly when needed, reducing storage costs.
* **Production Continuity:** Prevents costly downtime caused by material shortages.
* **Smart Dashboard:** Visualizes inventory health and predicted usage rates in real-time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Intelligence:** Machine Learning Predictive Algorithms (Supply Chain Optimization)
* **Backend:** Laravel (PHP)
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Industrial Dashboard Design)
* **Database:** MySQL
